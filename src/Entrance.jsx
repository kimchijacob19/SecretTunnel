      <h1>Cave Entrance</h1>
      <p>Your journey has brought you to the base of a rocky mountain.</p>
      <p>
        The quickest path forward is through the mountain's winding tunnels, but
        a sturdy metal gate sits closed before you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two giant badgers stand guard on either side of the gate, their eyes
        fixed on you. The one on the left opens its mouth, and with a deep,
        rumbling voice, it asks, "Who approaches? Speak your name."
      </p>

          Name
